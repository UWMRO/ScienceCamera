    A one-dimensional spacer along only the major axis for any BoxSizer

    Found this on a wxPython tutorial and it has proved to be very handy.

    It takes in a box sizer as boxsizer and the spacing as pixelSpacing and expands the
    passed in sizer along its major axis.  This is used over boxsizer.AddSpacer(...) as this
    expands along both axises causing untold issues.  It also is more intuitive than
    boxsizer.AddSpacer((..,..)) where you pass a 0 to the width or height to obtain the same
    results.
